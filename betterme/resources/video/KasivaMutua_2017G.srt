1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,396
"Listen.

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,620
Do you hear that?"

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,860
my grandmother asked me.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,356
"Listen.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,420
Listen to what the beetle is saying."

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,116
I would spend hours and hours listening to the little beetle

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,636
rolling a huge ball of dung,

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,196
and while at it,

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,780
I heard a variety of environmental sounds.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,756
With the keenest of ears, I would hear family chatter,

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,196
laughter,

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,756
the wind howling

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,540
and even crickets chirping.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,636
All these sounds crisscrossed into each other,

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,500
and I would hear rhythm in between.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,836
Then I would beat my plate with a spoon and my chest with my tiny hands

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,900
trying to recreate what I was hearing.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,316
I have been beating the same plates,

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,276
shakers, drums, pans and so much more ever since

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,636
to become a professional drummer

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,860
and percussionist.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,060
(Applause)

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,716
As I grew up, subconsciously,

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,036
I felt a strong urge to hide my newfound hobby.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,356
Even without it being said out loud,

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,700
I knew that somehow it was wrong to do what I was doing.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,356
In most of the ceremonies,

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,476
I noticed that most of the women and girls were not in sight,

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,036
but when they were,

30
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,596
I noticed that they would wear their dancing skirts

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,036
and shake their waists off,

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,836
singing, clapping, ululating,

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,140
while the men filled up the rhythm section.

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,956
A few years later, I came to understand

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,876
what tradition and culture meant,

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,076
and what was considered taboo

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,300
or otherwise.

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,060
In the majority of African cultures,

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,596
women have been forbidden to play drums and percussion

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,100
for a very long time.

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,076
I believe this taboo stems from the psychological and traditional belief

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,580
that the woman is an inferior being.

43
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,556
I grew up hearing that the place of the woman is in the kitchen

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,860
or in the other room.

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Mhm?

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,220
(Laughter)

47
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,596
Women had been brainwashed and led on for so long

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,460
until we had fallen victim and actually started believing in this ourselves.

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,996
This, coupled with the lack of interest to educate women,

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,916
played a major, major role

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,540
in etching this into our minds.

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,996
The sounds of the drum provoke emotion and movement.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,420
Essentially, the drum is a very sensual instrument.

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,436
Once at a festival, a man asked me

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,540
how I dared put a drum in between my legs.

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,100
I have been considered loose and dirty for playing an instrument.

57
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,836
I have repeatedly been questioned

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,196
why I would choose to play drums

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,316
instead of practicing journalism,

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,236
which I studied for my undergraduate,

61
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,660
which has been termed "more decent."

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,436
The sight of a woman playing drums enfeebles her,

63
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,740
makes her less feminine,

64
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,956
less desirable,

65
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,300
but all this optimally puts her on a lower social stand.

66
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,236
Drumming has essentially represented the strong African heritage,

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,716
and its importance can be seen

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,860
in the many aspects of the African tradition.

69
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,036
Many communities encompass drumming in their day-to-day activities,

70
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,996
and still do up to date,

71
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,116
from childbirths to initiation ceremonies,

72
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,116
welcoming ceremonies,

73
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,060
marriages and even burials.

74
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,836
However, this same drum

75
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,356
is disappearing very fast from the music scene,

76
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,356
and the traditional genre is losing its popularity

77
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,340
very quickly amongst the people.

78
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,156
Inspired by the need to preserve this culture,

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,676
I am teaching the significance and the importance of the drum

80
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,220
to young boys, women and girls.

81
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,276
In my journey as a percussion teacher,

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,356
I have realized that very many women

83
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,635
actually want to play the drum,

84
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,556
but at the same time,

85
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,156
they fear it.

86
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,556
Some fear how society will perceive them.

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,756
Others fear the physical pain that comes with playing.

88
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh yes, it's not that easy.

89
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,316
Some, because their spouses don't approve of them,

90
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,876
and others generally fear the responsibility

91
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
of being a bearer of culture.

92
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,276
I believe, or I think that all these fears

93
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,116
are etched in the collective feminine cautiousness

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,956
because when we learn of the atrocities that have happened to women,

95
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,316
continentally especially,

96
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,076
it serves as a constant reminder

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,316
that one step out of our designated place

98
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,300
may end up in very serious consequences.

99
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,276
Well, I use my drum to tell my story and my people's stories.

100
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,540
My roots shaped me and my culture is here to stay with me.

101
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,916
Women can be custodians of culture, too.

102
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,276
We are born to bring forth life,

103
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,876
to nurture it.

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,900
We can definitely preserve our traditions very, very excellently.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,300
My drum and I,

106
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,740
we are here to stay.

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,156
(Applause)

108
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,420
We are definitely here to stay.

109
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,116
If women have led countries,

110
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,476
women have gone to space,

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,716
women have won Grammys,

112
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,956
then the same, same women can play the drum

113
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,996
and play it -- to a five-star rating?

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,276
No, to a million-star rating.

115
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,516
Thank you.

116
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,820
(Applause)

117
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,740
(Chiming)

118
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,260
(Metallic drumming)

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,180
(Chiming)

120
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,620
(Rattling)

121
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,580
(Drumming)

122
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,660
(Applause)
